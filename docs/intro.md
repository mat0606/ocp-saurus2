# Getting Started {#getting_started}

Welcome to the Openshift Container Platform (OCP) on Nutanix HCI workshop.

This workbook accompanies an instructor-led session that introduces OCP on Nutanix HCI, Infrastructure lifecycle management for OCP using
Nutanix Calm, OCP using Nutanix HCI storage (volumes), and many common
management tasks. Each section has a lesson and an exercise to give you
hands-on practice. The instructor explains the exercises and answers any
additional questions that you may have.

Lifecycle management for kubernetes and storage yet another silo within
IT, introducing unnecessary complexity and suffering from the same
issues of scale and lack of continuous innovation seen in SAN storage.

Nutanix believes there is no room for silos in the Enterprise Cloud. By
approaching Infrastructure and storage as an app, running in software on
top of a proven HCI core, Nutanix delivers high performance,
scalability, and rapid innovation through One-Click management.

## Initial Setup

-   Take note of the *Passwords* being used from you RX reservation details
-   Log into your virtual desktops (connection info below)
-   Login to Global Protect VPN if you have access

## Cluster Assignment

The instructor will inform the attendees of their assigned clusters.

:::note

If these are Single Node Clusters (SNCs) pay close attention on the networking part. The SNCs are setup and configured differently to the 3 or 4 node clusters

:::

## Environment Details

Nutanix Workshops are intended to be run in the Nutanix Hosted POC
environment. Your cluster will be provisioned with all necessary images,
networks, and VMs required to complete the exercises.

### Networking

As we are able to provide three/four node clusters and single node
clusters in the HPOC environment, we need to describe each sort of
cluster separately. The clusters are setup and configured differently.

#### Three/Four node HPOC clusters

Three or four node Hosted POC clusters follow a standard naming
convention:

-   **Cluster Name** - POC*XYZ*
-   **Subnet** - 10.**42**.*XYZ*.0
-   **Cluster IP** - 10.**42**.*XYZ*.37

For example:

-   **Cluster Name** - POC055
-   **Subnet** - 10.42.55.0
-   **Cluster IP** - 10.42.55.37 for the VIP of the Cluster

Throughout the Workshop there are multiple instances where you will need
to substitute *XYZ* with the correct octet for your subnet, for example:

| IP Address     |   Description |
| -------------- | --------------- |
| 10.42.*XYZ*.37 |  Nutanix Cluster Virtual IP   |
| 10.42.*XYZ*.39 |  **PC** VM IP, Prism Central |
| 10.42.*XYZ*.41  |  **DC** VM IP, NTNXLAB.local Domain Controller   |


Each cluster is configured with 2 VLANs which can be used for VMs:


|Network Name     | Address             | VLAN    | DHCP Scope|
|-----------------| ------------------- |-------- | -----------|
|Primary          | 10.42.*XYZ*.1/25    | 0       | 10.42.*XYZ*.50-10.42.*XYZ*.124|
|Secondary        | 10.42.*XYZ*.129/25  | *XYZ1*  | 10.42.*XYZ*.132-10.42.*XYZ*.253|


#### Single Node HPOC Clusters

For some workshops we are using Single Node Clusters (SNC). The reason
for this is to allow more people to have a dedicated cluster but still
have enough free clusters for the bigger workshops including those for
customers.

The network in the SNC config is using a /26 network. This splits the
network address into four equal sizes that can be used for workshops.
The below table describes the setup of the network in the four
partitions. It provides essential information for the workshop with
respect to the IP addresses and the services running at that IP address.


|Partition 1     |Partition 2      | Partition 3      | Partition 4    | Service     |  Comment
|--------------- |---------------  |----------------- |----------------- |------------- |---------------

### Credentials

:::note

The *Cluster Password* is unique to each cluster and will be
provided by the leader of the Workshop.

:::

| Credential        | Username                 | Password           |
|------------------ |------------------------- |--------------------|
| Prism Element     | admin                    | *Cluster Password* |

| Prism Central VM  | nutanix                  | *Cluster Password* |

Each cluster has a dedicated domain controller VM, **DC**, responsible
for providing AD services for the **NTNXLAB.local** domain. The domain
is populated with the following Users and Groups:


| Group            | Username(s)              | Password |
