# Create Persisnt Volume Claim (PVC)for Nutanix Volume

Managing storage is a distinct problem from managing compute resources. OpenShift Container Platform uses the Kubernetes persistent volume (PV) framework to allow cluster administrators to provision persistent storage for a cluster. Developers can use persistent volume claims (PVCs) to request PV resources without having specific knowledge of the underlying storage infrastructure.

## Create Persistent Volume Claim

1.  Click on **Storage**->**Persistent Volume Claim**.  Click on **Create Persistent Volume Claim**
